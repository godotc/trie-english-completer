# English Completer

A toy of a text editor. Which will complete english words based on trietree.

GUI framework  I choose Qt. So most feature's implementaion just from packge, and this not a project start from lower level.

1. Trie tree to orgnaize englsh words dataset.
2. Qt as GUI framework.
3. Trigger complete prompt pannel when typing words.
